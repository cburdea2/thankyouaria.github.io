					<p>So obviously you managed to draw a QR-Code that is interpretable by a scanner. Good job! Now get ready for a site that I have been working on for a while; I guess you understand now why I was happy about the delay of the delivery. I needed the extra time to do this here. Have fun!</p>

						<h2>Thank you so much</h2>

					<p>I havent told you yet because I wanted to tell you this in a 'proper' setting: I think I wont exeggarate when saying that you played a big role in my way to Microsoft. I think I wouldnt be there without all your help and I am truly thankful for that. It started with all the support during the interview phase
						and then all the emotional support you provided. Thank your for helping me landing my dream job! I am deeply humbled.

				<p>Aria is going to Europa! I still can't believe that. This is sumply such a crazy story. People are paying you to study about your favorite topic; isn't that insane? The literally sit in a room, saw your application and decided: "yup this girl gets all our money.". 
					For real. I am impressed and looking super forward to see this future european bring some democracy to Europe.
